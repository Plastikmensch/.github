# Contribution Guidelines

Contributions are generally welcome.  
Contributions include opening PRs, Feature Requests and Bug reports.  
Please adhere to provided templates.  

**Before spending a lot of time working on something, ask for feedback first**  

## Code Style

Please adhere to provided linter configurations.

## Rules
1. Never commit directly to main (formerly master), create new branches. 
2. Document your code.  
3. Use [typed commits](https://udacity.github.io/git-styleguide/)
4. [Commit signature verification](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/about-commit-signature-verification) is required.
5. Commits need to be signed-off.

## Signing off commits

Commits can be signed-off manually by appending the following text to commits:
```
<commit message>

Signed-off by: Author name <Author e-mail>
```

Commits can also be signed off automatically by using `git commit -s`.  
Most IDEs support the `-s` flag. Look for a setting called `sign-off` or similar.  
The `-s` flag uses your `user.name` and `user.email` set by `git config`.

Please make sure author name and author e-mail matches your username and GitHub no-reply address or publicly visible info added to your GitHub account.

By signing off your commits, you agree to the following terms:
```
